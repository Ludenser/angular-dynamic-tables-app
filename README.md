# Your Application Name

This README provides the necessary information to get your application up and running. The application utilizes Angular for the frontend and a JSON Server for simulating a backend API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (Latest stable version recommended)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager), usually installed with Node.js
- **Angular CLI** (Can be installed globally with npm)
- **Node Foreman (nf)**, for managing processes

If Angular CLI is not installed, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
To install Node Foreman, use the following command:

```bash

npm install -g foreman
```
Installation
First, clone the repository or download the source code of the application to your local machine. Then navigate to the application directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

```bash

cd path_to_your_application
npm install
This will install all dependencies listed in the package.json file.
```
Running the Application
After installing the dependencies, you can run the application using Node Foreman. In the root directory of your application, create a Procfile (without any file extension) that contains instructions for starting your application and the development server. Here's an example of what the Procfile might look like:
```Procfile
web: npm run start
api: npm run start:dev:server
```
This tells Node Foreman to run the Angular application (web) and the JSON Server (api) as separate processes.

Now, you can start the application using the following command:

```bash
nf start
```
This command will start both the frontend and backend parts of your application. After starting, you can access your application through a web browser, usually at http://localhost:4200, and the API will be available at http://localhost:3000, unless configured otherwise.

Other Available Scripts
In your package.json, there are also additional scripts available for development and building the application:

ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.
ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
ng build --watch --configuration development to build the project and watch for changes, using the development configuration.
